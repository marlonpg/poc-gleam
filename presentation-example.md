# Gleam Language Presentation

## 1. Introduction to Gleam (3-5 minutes)
- **History and Origins**: Gleam is a functional programming language created by Louis Pilfold. It is designed to be highly performant, type-safe, and to run on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). It was created to provide a language with strong types and excellent tooling for the Erlang ecosystem.
- **Key Influences**: Gleam is influenced by languages like Elm, Rust, and Haskell, particularly in its emphasis on type safety and simplicity.
- **Use Cases**: Gleam is used primarily for building highly concurrent and fault-tolerant systems, similar to Erlang and Elixir. It can be ideal for applications that require scalability, like web servers, real-time systems, or distributed applications.
- **Community and Popularity**: While Gleam is still a relatively niche language, its appeal is growing, particularly in the Erlang and Elixir communities, as it combines the strengths of these ecosystems with static typing.

## 2. Core Features of Gleam (5-7 minutes)
- **Syntax and Style**: Gleam’s syntax is simple and clean. For example, here’s a basic "Hello, World!" program:

  ```gleam
  fn main() {
    io.println("Hello, world!")
  }
  ```
  It uses familiar functional syntax, making it accessible to developers with a background in Elm or Haskell.

- **Paradigms**: Gleam is a purely functional language, meaning functions are first-class citizens and immutability is strongly encouraged.

- **Strong vs. Weak Typing**: Gleam uses static and strong typing, ensuring that most errors are caught at compile-time rather than runtime. It avoids runtime issues like `null` or undefined behavior.

- **Performance Considerations**: Since Gleam runs on the BEAM VM, it inherits the strong concurrency model and fault tolerance of the Erlang ecosystem. Performance is highly optimized for concurrent systems, similar to Erlang and Elixir.
